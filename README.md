# Zacke.dev

I stared to play around with github actions and azure static site hosting and needed a project to host so
this is the repository for my contact page [me.zacke.dev](https://me.zacke.dev/).

The plan is to port and migrate what's over at [montell.se](http://montell.se/#contact) that I think I wrote in knockback.js a while ago.
